# Cubes-Crash
Project for Computer Graphics Course @ Alma Mater Studiorum.

## Description
The game is based on WebGL. There are 3 game modes:
* Free camera: in this mode the player can move (with WASD) and rotate (with arrows) the camera, thus viewing the entire scene.  
* 3rd person: in this mode the game starts as soon as the player presses one of the movement buttons (WASD). The count down will start and the goal is to go through the highest possible number of circles. Be aware to avoid the iron cubes: if you collide with them you will lose some points!
* Top-view: this mode works the same as the previous one, but the view is from the top

## Assets
* All 3D models and textures have been created by myself with the use of Blender
* I used some external library: they are all placed under the `resources` folder
